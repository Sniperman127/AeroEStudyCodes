# Numerical Methods and Analysis

## First Week
### Systems of Linear Equations and Solutions of equations in one variable.

While solving various problems that arise through out Mathematics and its applications, we generally come across a system of linear equations and solutions of such problems is what we will address in this section.

1.  Solution for normal, underdetermined, and overdetermined cases.
2.  Introduction to matrix decomposition
3.  Solutions of equations in one variable
4.  Iterative Methods
